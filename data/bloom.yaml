# Config file for the tagger analyzer.
#
# Each definition needs to define either a query_string or a query_dsl.
#
# The create_view is an optional boolean that determines whether a view
# should be created if there are hits.
#
# The tagger works in the way that the query is run and the emojis and
# tags that are defined are applied to the matching events.
# A view is created if the tag is added (only if there are results).
#
# Example:
#
# test_tagger:
#        query_string: 'test'
#        tags: ['test-tag']
#        emojis: ['FISHING_POLE']
#        create_view: true
#        view_name: 'TEST view name'
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

#TODO: Check if it makes sense to define some types like md5, sha1, sha256, ip, URI, domain
# and add regular expressions at it to be also able to extract that values from message field
# if the values are not present in specific fields through the parsing
